## Resilience Analysis of Traffic Infrastructure using Loss of Serviceability Index

##### - This paper discusses a novel method to evaluate how well traffic infrastructure can handle disruptions, like floods, by looking at the loss of serviceability. They applied this method to a case study in Trier, Germany, finding that the Kaiser-Wilhelm Br√ºcke bridge was the most critical area affected by flooding.

##### - The paper introduces a methodology using Loss of Serviceability (LoS) to assess traffic infrastructure resilience during disruptive events, demonstrated in a flooded area in Trier, Germany.


##### - Insights from the analysis can guide policymakers to enhance transportation system reliability and robustness in similar contexts.

##### - Resilience of traffic systems is achieved through defining resilience, formulating resilience measures, and analyzing resilience measures to understand system robustness.

##### - The case study demonstrates the LoS index methodology using OpenStreetMap and OSMnx to calculate LoS index for flooded areas in Trier and identify critical edges.

##### - Quantitative measures like probability of susceptibility, economic costs, recovery time, and disruption levels are used to measure transportation infrastructure resilience.

##### - The Loss of Serviceability index is utilized to calculate network resilience by considering affected and non-affected areas, identifying critical edges in the network.

##### - For applying our method we choose Tries as a case study. We extracted road networks from Trier main city, nearby Mossel river. Which are more prone to affected by the natural disestar.

## We have extracted road network using OSMnx Library in python

## For reducing time complexity, we have selected some important source and destination point (e.g - hospital, fire station, school) to calculate the LoS value
